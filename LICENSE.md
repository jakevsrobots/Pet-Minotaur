Copy-it-right, circa 2020

"First, it’s okay to copy! Believe in the process of copying as much as you
can; with all your heart is a good place to start - get into it as straight and
honestly as possible. Copying is as good (I think better from this vector-view)
as any other way of getting 'there.'" 
– NOTES ON THE AESTHETICS OF 'copying-an-Image Processor' - Phil Morton (1973)
